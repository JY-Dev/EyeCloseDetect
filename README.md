# Android App for Real-time EyeCloseing Detection

Fast Face is an android application which detects facial landmark . It detects 68 landmarks of human face <br />
chin to eyebrow in real-time. Also, it can detect people up to 3 if you guys show your frontal faces. <br /> 

It is an upgraded version of [dlib-android](https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android), Not only revising the code but additional task for optimizing dlib library was needed. 
As a result, Fast Face speeds up 2x or more from the original. Higher resoluton and higher detection speed.<br />

And I added Pytorch Lib for Detection Eye closing.<br />
It used by Dlib + Pytorch<br />
